[[algorithms-embeddings-fastrp-introduction]]
== Introduction

Fast Random Projection, or FastRP for short, is a node embedding algorithm in the family of random projection algorithms.
These algorithms are theoretically backed by the Johnsson-Lindenstrauss lemma according to which one can project _n_ vectors of _arbitrary_ dimension into _O(log(n))_ dimensions and still approximately preserve pairwise distances among the points.
In fact, a linear projection chosen in a random way satisfies this property.

Such techniques therefore allow for aggressive dimensionality reduction while preserving most of the distance information.
The FastRP algorithm operates on graphs, in which case we care about preserving similarity between nodes and their neighbors.
This means that two nodes that have similar neighborhoods should be assigned similar embedding vectors.
Conversely, two nodes that are not similar should be not be assigned similar embedding vectors.

The FastRP algorithm initially assigns random vectors to all nodes using a technique called _very sparse random projection_, see (Achlioptas, 2003) below.
Moreover, in GDS it is possible to use node properties for the creation of these _initial random vectors_ in a way described xref:machine-learning/node-embeddings/fastrp.adoc#algorithms-embeddings-fastrp-examples-properties[below].
We will also use _projection of a node_ synonymously with the initial random vector of a node.

Starting with these random vectors and iteratively averaging over node neighborhoods, the algorithm constructs a sequence of _intermediate embeddings_ image:equations/fastrp/fastrp1.svg[e n to the ith] for each node _n_.
More precisely,

image::equations/fastrp/fastrp2.svg[e n to the ith equals average of e m to the ith minus one,align="center"]

where _m_ ranges over neighbors of _n_ and image:equations/fastrp/fastrp3.svg[e n to the zeroeth] is the node's initial random vector.

The embedding image:equations/fastrp/fastrp4.svg[e n] of node _n_, which is the output of the algorithm, is a combination of the vectors and embeddings defined above:

image::equations/fastrp/fastrp5.svg[e n equals w zero times normalise r n plus sum from i equals 1 to k of w i times normalise e n to the ith,align="center"]

where `normalize` is the function which divides a vector with its https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics)#Euclidean_norm[L2 norm], the value of `nodeSelfInfluence` is image:equations/fastrp/fastrp6.svg[w zero], and the values of `iterationWeights` are image:equations/fastrp/fastrp7.svg[w 1 comma w 2 comma dot dot dot w k].
We will return to xref:machine-learning/node-embeddings/fastrp.adoc#algorithms-embeddings-fastrp-node-self-influence[Node Self Influence] later on.

Therefore, each node's embedding depends on a neighborhood of radius equal to the number of iterations.
This way FastRP exploits higher-order relationships in the graph while still being highly scalable.

The present implementation extends the original algorithm to support weighted graphs, which computes weighted averages of neighboring embeddings using the relationship weights.
In order to make use of this, the `relationshipWeightProperty` parameter should be set to an existing relationship property.

The original algorithm is intended only for undirected graphs.
We support running on both on directed graphs and undirected graph.
For directed graphs we consider only the outgoing neighbors when computing the intermediate embeddings for a node.
Therefore, using the orientations `NATURAL`, `REVERSE` or `UNDIRECTED` will all give different embeddings.
In general, it is recommended to first use `UNDIRECTED` as this is what the original algorithm was evaluated on.

For more information on this algorithm see:

* https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.11512.pdf[H. Chen, S.F. Sultan, Y. Tian, M. Chen, S. Skiena: Fast and Accurate Network Embeddings via Very Sparse Random Projection, 2019.^]

=== Node properties

Most real-world graphs contain node properties which store information about the nodes and what they represent.
The FastRP algorithm in the GDS library extends the original FastRP algorithm with a capability to take node properties into account.
The resulting embeddings can therefore represent the graph more accurately.

The node property aware aspect of the algorithm is configured via the parameters `featureProperties` and `propertyRatio`.
Each node property in `featureProperties` is associated with a randomly generated vector of dimension `propertyDimension`, where `propertyDimension = embeddingDimension * propertyRatio`.
Each node is then initialized with a vector of size `embeddingDimension` formed by concatenation of two parts:

. The first part is formed like in the standard FastRP algorithm,
. The second one is a linear combination of the property vectors, using the property values of the node as weights.

The algorithm then proceeds with the same logic as the FastRP algorithm.
Therefore, the algorithm will output arrays of size `embeddingDimension`.
The last `propertyDimension` coordinates in the embedding captures information about property values of nearby nodes (the "property part" below), and the remaining coordinates (`embeddingDimension` - `propertyDimension` of them; "topology part") captures information about nearby presence of nodes.

=== Usage in machine learning pipelines

It may be useful to generate node embeddings with FastRP as a node property step in a machine learning pipeline (like xref:machine-learning/linkprediction-pipelines/link-prediction.adoc[] and xref:machine-learning/node-property-prediction/index.adoc[]).
Since FastRP is a random algorithm and xref:machine-learning/node-embeddings/index.adoc#node-embeddings-generalization[inductive] only for `propertyRatio=1.0`, there are some things to have in mind.

In order for a machine learning model to be able to make useful predictions, it is important that features produced during prediction are of a similar distribution to the features produced during training of the model.
Moreover, node property steps (whether FastRP or not) added to a pipeline are executed both during training, and during the prediction by the trained model.
It is therefore problematic when a pipeline contains an embedding step which yields all too dissimilar embeddings during training and prediction.

This has some implications on how to use FastRP as a node property step.
In general, if a pipeline is trained using FastRP as a node property step on some graph "g", then the resulting trained model should only be applied to graphs that are not too dissimilar to "g".

If `propertyRatio<1.0`, most of the nodes in the graph that a prediction is being run on, must be the same nodes (in the database sense) as in the original graph "g" that was used during training.
The reason for this is that FastRP is a random algorithm, and in this case is seeded based on the nodes' ids in the Neo4j database from whence the nodes came.

If `propertyRatio=1.0` however, the random initial node embeddings are derived from node property vectors only, so there is no random seeding based on node ids.

Additionally, in order for the initial random vectors (independent of `propertyRatio` used) to be consistent between runs (training and prediction calls), a value for the `randomSeed` configuration parameter must be provided when adding the FastRP node property step to the training pipeline.


[[algorithms-embeddings-fastrp-parameter-tuning]]
== Tuning algorithm parameters

In order to improve the embedding quality using FastRP on one of your graphs, it is possible to tune the algorithm parameters.
This process of finding the best parameters for your specific use case and graph is typically referred to as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter_optimization[hyperparameter tuning].
We will go through each of the configuration parameters and explain how they behave.

For statistically sound results, it is a good idea to reserve a test set excluded from parameter tuning.
After selecting a set of parameter values, the embedding quality can be evaluated using a downstream machine learning task on the test set.
By varying the parameter values and studying the precision of the machine learning task, it is possible to deduce the parameter values that best fit the concrete dataset and use case.
To construct such a set you may want to use a dedicated node label in the graph to denote a subgraph without the test data.


=== Embedding dimension

The embedding dimension is the length of the produced vectors.
A greater dimension offers a greater precision, but is more costly to operate over.

The optimal embedding dimension depends on the number of nodes in the graph.
Since the amount of information the embedding can encode is limited by its dimension, a larger graph will tend to require a greater embedding dimension.
A typical value is a power of two in the range 128 - 1024.
A value of at least 256 gives good results on graphs in the order of 10^5^ nodes, but in general increasing the dimension improves results.
Increasing embedding dimension will however increase memory requirements and runtime linearly.


=== Normalization strength

The normalization strength is used to control how node degrees influence the embedding.
Using a negative value will downplay the importance of high degree neighbors, while a positive value will instead increase their importance.
The optimal normalization strength depends on the graph and on the task that the embeddings will be used for.
In the original paper, hyperparameter tuning was done in the range of `[-1,0]` (no positive values), but we have found cases where a positive normalization strengths gives better results.


=== Iteration weights

The iteration weights parameter control two aspects: the number of iterations, and their relative impact on the final node embedding.
The parameter is a list of numbers, indicating one iteration per number where the number is the weight applied to that iteration.

In each iteration, the algorithm will expand across all relationships in the graph.
This has some implications:

* With a single iteration, only direct neighbors will be considered for each node embedding.
* With two iterations, direct neighbors and second-degree neighbors will be considered for each node embedding.
* With three iterations, direct neighbors, second-degree neighbors, and third-degree neighbors will be considered for each node embedding.
Direct neighbors may be reached twice, in different iterations.
* In general, the embedding corresponding to the `i`:th iteration contains features depending on nodes reachable with paths of length `i`.
If the graph is undirected, then a node reachable with a path of length `L` can also be reached with length `L+2k`, for any integer `k`.
* In particular, a node may reach back to itself on each even iteration (depending on the direction in the graph).

It is good to have at least one non-zero weight in an even and in an odd position.
Typically, using at least a few iterations, for example three, is recommended.
However, a too high value will consider nodes far away and may not be informative or even be detrimental.
The intuition here is that as the projections reach further away from the node, the less specific the neighborhood becomes.
Of course, a greater number of iterations will also take more time to complete.


[[algorithms-embeddings-fastrp-node-self-influence]]
=== Node Self Influence

Node Self Influence is a variation of the original FastRP algorithm.

How much a node's embedding is affected by the intermediate embedding at iteration _i_ is controlled by the _i_'th element of `iterationWeights`.
This can also be seen as how much the initial random vectors, or projections, of nodes that can be reached in _i_ hops from a node affect the embedding of the node.
Similarly, `nodeSelfInfluence` behaves like an iteration weight for a _0_ th iteration, or the amount of influence the projection of a node has on the embedding of the same node.

A reason for setting this parameter to a non-zero value is if your graph has low connectivity or a significant amount of isolated nodes.
Isolated nodes combined with using `propertyRatio = 0.0` leads to embeddings that contain all zeros.
However using node properties along with node self influence can thus produce more meaningful embeddings for such nodes.
This can be seen as producing fallback features when graph structure is (locally) missing.
Moreover, sometimes a node's own properties are simply informative features and are good to include even if connectivity is high.
Finally, node self influence can be used for pure dimensionality reduction to compress node properties used for node classification.

If node properties are not used, using `nodeSelfInfluence` may also have a positive effect, depending on other settings and on the problem.


=== Orientation

Choosing the right orientation when creating the graph may have the single greatest impact.
The FastRP algorithm is designed to work with undirected graphs, and we expect this to be the best in most cases.
If you expect only outgoing or incoming relationships to be informative for a prediction task, then you may want to try using the orientations `NATURAL` or `REVERSE` respectively.

This graph represents seven people who know one another.
A relationship property `weight` denotes the strength of the knowledge between two persons.

With the graph in Neo4j we can now project it into the graph catalog to prepare it for algorithm execution.
We do this using a native projection targeting the `Person` nodes and the `KNOWS` relationships.
For the relationships we will use the `UNDIRECTED` orientation.
This is because the FastRP algorithm has been measured to compute more predictive node embeddings in undirected graphs.
We will also add the `weight` relationship property which we will make use of when running the weighted version of FastRP.

The results of the algorithm are not very intuitively interpretable, as the node embedding format is a mathematical abstraction of the node within its neighborhood, designed for machine learning programs.
What we can see is that the embeddings have four elements (as configured using `embeddingDimension`) and that the numbers are relatively small (they all fit in the range of `[-2, 2]`).
The magnitude of the numbers is controlled by the `embeddingDimension`, the number of nodes in the graph, and by the fact that FastRP performs euclidean normalization on the intermediate embedding vectors.

[NOTE]
====
Due to the random nature of the algorithm the results will vary between the runs.
However, this does not necessarily mean that the pairwise distances of two node embeddings vary as much.

Since the initial state of the algorithm is randomised, it isn't possible to intuitively analyse the effect of the relationship weights.

=== Using node properties as features

To explain the novel initialization using node properties, let us consider an example where `embeddingDimension` is 10, `propertyRatio` is 0.2.
The dimension of the embedded properties, `propertyDimension` is thus 2.
Assume we have a property `f1` of scalar type, and a property `f2` storing arrays of length 2.
This means that there are 3 features which we order like `f1` followed by the two values of `f2`.
For each of these three features we sample a two dimensional random vector.
Let's say these are `p1=[0.0, 2.4]`, `p2=[-2.4, 0.0]` and `p3=[2.4, 0.0]`.
Consider now a node `(n {f1: 0.5, f2: [1.0, -1.0]})`.
The linear combination mentioned above, is in concrete terms `0.5 * p1 + 1.0 * p2 - 1.0 * p3 = [-4.8, 1.2]`.
The initial random vector for the node `n` contains first 8 values sampled as in the original FastRP paper, and then our computed values `-4.8` and `1.2`, totalling 10 entries.

In the example below, we again set the embedding dimension to 2, but we set `propertyRatio` to 1, which means the embedding is computed from node properties only.

In this example, the embeddings are based on the `age` property.
Because of L2 normalization which is applied to each iteration (here only one iteration), all nodes have the same embedding despite having different age values (apart from rounding errors).
